# Unity - Game Jam Project Jan 2022
 A Unity project I created with a few friends for an itch.io game jam ("My First Game Jam: Winter 2022") from 15/01/2022 - 29/01/2022. This project, while nothing more than a prototype, served as a useful learning experience for working in Unity and C#. Majority of programming was done by me, with some help from a friend, art/music was also done by friends. Created using Unity version 2020.3.26f1. Code can be found in Nature\Assets\Scripts.
